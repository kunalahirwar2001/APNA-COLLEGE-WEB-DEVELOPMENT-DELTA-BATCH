        Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of
        York; And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of
        the ocean buried. Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; Our
        bruised arms hung up for monuments; Our stern alarums changed to merry
        meetings, Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. Grim-visaged war
        hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;

        And now, instead of mounting barded steeds To fright the souls of fearful
        adversaries, He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber To the lascivious
        pleasing of a lute. But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, Nor
        made to court an amorous looking-glass; I, that am rudely stamp'd, and
        want love's majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; I, that am
        curtail'd of this fair proportion,
